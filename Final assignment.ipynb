    "#### This data analytics project will concern choosing the best location in Rotterdam to set up a cafe. Rotterdam is a bustling student city and there are already a lot of cafes around. Therefore, the owner would like to know where it is best to set up a cafe. The Neighbourhood should ideally be trendy and visited by people, but there should not be too many cafes already so that the competition is not too high. The owner of the restaurant is interested in knowing the answer to this question, because it will maximize the profit. Therefore, the question is: Which neighbourhood is the best to set up a restaurant given that Rotterdam is a competitive environment for cafes?"
